{
  "soil": "Use compost and legumes to improve soil fertility. Add organic matter like leaf mulch, manure, and cover crops. Test your soil pH and adjust with lime or sulfur as needed.",
  "pest": "Use neem oil or ladybugs to control pests. Plant companion plants like marigolds and basil. Use physical barriers like row covers and hand-pick larger pests.",
  "compost": "Try vermicomposting or green/brown composting. Mix kitchen scraps, yard waste, and manure. Turn regularly and keep moist for best results.",
  "crop": "Rotate crops every season for better soil health. Group plants by family and avoid planting the same family in the same spot for 3-4 years.",
  "fertilizer": "Use organic fertilizers like fish emulsion, bone meal, and kelp meal. Compost tea is excellent for foliar feeding. Avoid synthetic fertilizers.",
  "watering": "Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth. Use drip irrigation or soaker hoses. Water early morning to reduce evaporation.",
  "seeds": "Start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost. Use seed starting mix and provide adequate light. Harden off seedlings before transplanting.",
  "harvest": "Harvest in the morning when plants are hydrated. Use clean, sharp tools. Store properly to maintain freshness and nutritional value.",
  "weeds": "Mulch heavily to suppress weeds. Use landscape fabric or cardboard under mulch. Hand-pull weeds before they go to seed.",
  "disease": "Practice crop rotation and proper spacing for air circulation. Remove infected plants immediately. Use disease-resistant varieties.",
  "mulch": "Apply 2-4 inches of organic mulch like straw, leaves, or wood chips. Mulch conserves moisture, suppresses weeds, and improves soil.",
  "beneficial": "Attract beneficial insects with flowering plants. Ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps help control pests naturally.",
  "greenhouse": "Use a greenhouse to extend growing seasons. Control temperature and humidity. Ventilate properly to prevent disease.",
  "hydroponics": "Hydroponic systems use nutrient-rich water instead of soil. Great for small spaces and year-round growing.",
  "aquaponics": "Combine fish farming with hydroponics. Fish waste provides nutrients for plants, plants filter water for fish.",
  "permaculture": "Design sustainable, self-sufficient ecosystems. Use companion planting, natural patterns, and renewable resources.",
  "biodynamic": "Biodynamic farming considers cosmic rhythms and lunar cycles. Use special preparations and treat the farm as a living organism.",
  "certified": "Get organic certification to verify your farming practices. Follow strict guidelines and maintain detailed records.",
  "market": "Sell at farmers markets, CSAs, or direct to restaurants. Build relationships with customers and tell your farming story.",
  "profit": "Focus on high-value crops and efficient production. Reduce costs through sustainable practices and local resources."
